# α-lang Virtual Machine

## What's its purpose?

This virtual machine was developed as a project for the [CS-340](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy340/) course of the [Computer Science Department](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/) of the University of Crete.
It can be used to load & execute the binary that is generated by the [alpha compiler](https://github.com/SteliosPapamichail/AlphaCompiler) in order for your a-lang program to run.

## Learning goals

1. Lexical Analysis using [Flex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_(lexical_analyser_generator))
2. Syntax Analysis using [Bison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Bison)
3. Intermediate code generation using Syntax Directed Translation
4. Target code generation
5. Virtual Machine emulation, architecture & functionality

## Using the α-VM

### How to build the project
Simply run `make` or `make all` in order to compile the α-vm and produce the `alphavm` executable.

### How to run an α (alpha) program
After compiling your Alpha (.asc) program, simply run `./alphavm [path-to-binary-file.abc] [optional -d]` to load and execute the binary file!
You can also provide the optional debug `-d` flag in order to print helpful debug info to the consle.

#### Side notes
This repository already icludes a sample `output.abc` file which corresponds to the binary file,
generated by compiling α-Compiler's `/tests/simple.asc` sample program.

**! IMPORTANT !**

The Virtual machine is still unfinished so many functionalities will probably not work for now, or may work incorrectly. Most likely, you will get assertion errors if you try to run a
relatively "complex" program. Hopefully its development will be completed soon (said every dev ever).
