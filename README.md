# CS-340-Compiler

### How to build the project
Simply run `make` or `make all` in order to compile both the compiler and the virtual machine.

### How to compile an alpha program
To compile your Alpha (.asc) program, simply run `./exec [path-to-file.asc] [optional -d]`. This command will
compile the program and generate the binary file to be passed to the Alpha virtual machine. If you want to see the SymbolTable entries, Quads, Constants Tables & Target code information that are generated by the compiler,
just add the `-d` flag after the source file's path.

### How to run the program through AVM
Run `./avm_exec [path-to-binary.abc] [optional -d]`. The default location of the generated binary file is
`./output.abc`. If you want to see the details that are read by the AVM using the binary file,
just add the `-d` flag after the binary's path.

### Notes
You can also perform the steps specified by `make all`
one by one. Simply run `make flex` in order to generate the `scanner.c` file, `make bison` to generate the parser.c (and its respective header file), `make tcode_gen` to create the target code generator and lastly, `make comp` in order to compile all the required source files and link them together to produce the final `exec` executable.
You can also use `make avm` to compile and link all the AVM-related files in order to generate the `avm_exec` executable.
